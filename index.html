         <h3> About me </h3>
         <p> Team player- eager to learn - ambitious</p>
         <p> I'm Yulisa, a second-year Creative Technology student with a strong interest in programming, technology, and innovation. I've been interested in engineering since I was young and chose a Beta profile in high school. After finishing high school, I took a gap year to figure out what I wanted to do. During that time, I explored different fields and realized I enjoy working with technology hands-on, which led me to the Bachelor program Creative Technology at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in collaboration with the University Twente.
            In my first 1.5 years of my degree, I've learned about various areas like <b>electrical and mechanical engineering</b>, design, and UX optimization. I've also built a solid foundation in programming with <b>Pythoon</b> and <b> Processing </b>. Through these experiences, I found that I’m passionate about technology, innovation and AI. Because of this, I think a Master’s in Robotics would be the perfect next step for me.
            My current average is <b>7.5/10</b>, and I like challenging myself by taking an <b>extra math course.</b>

         <h4>Deadlfit corrector</h4>
         <h5>Role: Software developer</h5>
         <p>
            During this project my team and I developed a deadlift corrector to improve posture. I developed the system using pyhton, openCV, mediaPipe and Iriun. When the user has an incorrect form while deadlifing the system would provide visual feedback to guide the user into the correct position. 
            UX was important therefor 3 user test where conducted an based uppon this the system design was improved.

         <h4>UV smart sensor system</h4>
         <h5>Role: Project leader</h5>
         <p>
            During this project my team and I developed a smart environment with UV sensors and a watch that would tell you to re apply sunscreen based. Through out this project I was the team leader overseeing the project and ensuring we were on track. In my position as project leader feedback from my pears was positive and later on stated that this project was the smoothest project due to my leadership In addition I improved my skills in documentation.
